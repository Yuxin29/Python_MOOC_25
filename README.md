# 🐍 Introduction to Programming in Python

This repository contains exercises from a introduction to programming Python from Helsinki Open University, split into **Basic** and **Advanced** sections. Each exercise focuses on learning Python syntax, control structures, data types, functions, and problem-solving using small, hands-on programs.

📦 **Sections**

### Basic
- Focuses on Python fundamentals: variables, loops, conditionals, lists, strings, and simple functions.  
- Exercises help develop understanding of program flow and basic data manipulation.  
- Ideal for learners new to programming or Python.

### Advanced
- Builds on the basics with more complex problems involving functions, file I/O, dictionaries, and modular code.  
- Exercises encourage problem-solving, code organization, and using Pythonic practices.  
- Prepares students for real-world Python programming challenges.
